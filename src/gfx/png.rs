//! A minimal PNG encoder (uncompressed deflate blocks), so headless snapshots of the
//! canvas need no image crate.
//!
//! A PNG file is an 8-byte signature followed by chunks. Each chunk is a big-endian `u32`
//! data length, a 4-byte type (`IHDR`, `IDAT`, `IEND`, ...), the data, and a CRC-32 over
//! the type and data. This encoder writes the minimum three chunks:
//!
//! - `IHDR`: width, height, bit depth 8, color type 2 (RGB), compression 0, filter method
//!   0, no interlacing.
//! - `IDAT`: the image as a zlib stream. The raw data is one filter-type byte per row
//!   (always 0, "none") followed by the row's RGB bytes.
//! - `IEND`: empty, marks the end.
//!
//! The zlib stream must be valid deflate, but deflate allows "stored" blocks that hold
//! bytes verbatim, so no compression code is needed. Snapshots are large, which is fine for
//! checking art.

/// - One stored block per 65535 bytes of input (the most a stored block can hold). Each block

///   on the last block) and BTYPE = 00 (stored). A stored block then skips to the next

///   single byte 0 or 1. LEN (a little-endian `u16`) and NLEN (its one's complement)
///   follow, then the raw bytes.
/// - The Adler-32 checksum of the uncompressed data, big-endian. Adler-32 keeps two sums
///   modulo 65521 (the largest prime below 2^16): `a` is 1 plus the sum of all bytes and
///   `b` is the sum of every intermediate `a`; the checksum is `b << 16 | a`.
